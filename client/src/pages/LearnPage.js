                <p>Biodiversity is the term we use to describe all the different kinds of life you can find in one areaâ€”the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and organisms work together in 
                    <span id='ecosystem-definition' className='definition'> ecosystems</span>
                , like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life.</p>

                    <h3>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
                    <p>Biodiversity supports a healthy and resilient environment. When lots of different types of plants, animals, and microorganisms are present, our environment can better withstand and recover from a variety of shocks and disruptions, including diseases and natural disasters. A rich variety of species helps humans by providing natural resources such as food, clean water, and medicine.</p>
