    content: "The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established in 2012 by 94 of the world's governments. This independent, intergovernmental body draws from experts across many scientific fields to guide and inform the development of policy both in government and the private sector. Now approaching 140 member states, IPBES is considered a foremost resource for biodiversity knowledge, and its assessments guide much of the policy that conserves our planet's wildlife.",
    quote: 'The overwhelming evidence of the IPBES Global Assessment, from a wide range of different fields of knowledge, presents an ominous picture. The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.',
