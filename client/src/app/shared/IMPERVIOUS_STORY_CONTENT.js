            'In the ensuing years, residents of the Love Canal area, now an established suburban community, complained about suspicious black fluids and foul odors in their yards and public playgrounds. In 1977, after a winter storm raised the water table and brought the buried contaminants to the surface, a study by the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation was conducted. It found toxic vapors from more than 80 compounds in many Love Canal homes, the result of groundwater leaching into basements and evaporating into the air.',

            'At the heart of the community effort to remediate this tragedy was Lois Gibbs, a local mother of two. Her family lived atop the dumping ground, and her son had developed epilepsy and asthma associated with exposure to chemical waste.',
