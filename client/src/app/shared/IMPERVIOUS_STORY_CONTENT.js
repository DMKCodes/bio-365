            'These surfaces are so named because they cannot absorb water. When it rains, water typically infiltrates the soil, is stored as groundwater, and is slowly discharged into nearby bodies of water. Impervious surfaces prevent infiltration and instead trap water above ground, leading to a host of problems including reduced groundwater recharge, increased water pollution, and localized flooding.'

These suburban areas are often characterized by low-density housing, increased reliance on automobiles for transportation, and the destruction and fragmentation of wildlife habitat.',
            'The simple fact is we are developing more land than our ecosystems can afford. A 2019 study of population and land-use dynamics found that in Lower Saxony, Germany, even municipalities that experienced population decline increased their urban land consumption. The corresponding increase in impervious surface cover reduced infiltration rates and increased evaporation and surface runoff.'
