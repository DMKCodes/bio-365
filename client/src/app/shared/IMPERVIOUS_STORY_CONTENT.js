            'These surfaces are so named because they cannot absorb water. When it rains, water typically infiltrates the soil, is stored as groundwater, and is slowly discharged into nearby bodies of water. Impervious surfaces prevent infiltration and instead trap water above ground, leading to a host of problems including reduced groundwater recharge, increased water pollution, and localized flooding.'

            'As the human population continues to swell, the expansion of cities and towns requires construction of new roads, neighborhoods, shopping centers, and walkways. These suburban areas are often characterized by low-density housing, increased reliance on automobiles for transportation, and the destruction and fragmentation of wildlife habitat.',
            'Over the past sixty years, humans have trended overwhelmingly toward living in urban areas. In 1960, the rural population was twice that of the urban population. By 2007, the distribution was roughly equal. And since then the urban population has skyrocketed, and the area dedicated to impervious surfaces has increased in kind.',
            "This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Living in a city offers many advantages: better access to essentials like healthcare and education, job opportunities, recreation, cultural diversity, and more. These benefits improve our quality of life, but they often come at an unsustainable price.",
            "To protect wildlife, we must redefine the way our cities and suburban areas are built. You'll learn some ways we can do this later on in the story."
